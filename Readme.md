For quick setup and testing, you can use the pre-built application images for CrowPanel Advance 2.8" and 3.5". Simply connect your panel via USB.

Download the appropriate archive — `firmware_2.8.7z` or `firmware_3.5.7z` — extract it, and run `FlashTool.exe`. The tool will automatically detect the connected panel and flash it with the application.

Source code for the applications is available in the `Sources_2.8` and `Sources_3.5` folders.
